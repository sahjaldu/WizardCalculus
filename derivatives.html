            <hr>
            <p>Derivatives are just the idea of a slope, just at a single point instead of two.</p>
            <p>When you were taught slope, you were taught that it was rise over run:</p>
            <img id="derivatives1" src="/images/derivative1.png" alt="linear function">
            <p>
                We use this equation to calculate the slope:
                $$
                \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>So, our slope is two. At any point on the graph, the slope will still be two.</p>
            <p>However, what about for more complicated line, like this quadratic function?</p>
            <img src="/images/derivative2.png" alt="quadratic function">
            <p>The slope is constantly changing for this function. It wouldn't make sense to find the slope 
                at a single point using our previous equation.</p>
            <p>
                What we can do, however, is bring our two points closer and closer together so 
                that our calculated rate of change is more and more accurate. See how the line 
                gets closer to a slope that better represents that part of the function as we bring 
                the points closer together.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/derivative3.gif" alt="tangent line gif">
            <p>A derivative is just the slope of two points brought so close together, that we can 
                basically just say that they are at a single point. As a result, we can find the 
                slope at one point, rather than two, making a more useful slope for non-linear 
                functions.</p><br>
            <h1>Defining a Derivative</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            <p>
                We define two point on a function $f(x)$, a $\text{Point 1}$ and 
                $\text{Point 2}$. $\text{Point 1}$ has coordinates $(x_{1}, y_{1})$, 
                and $\text{Point 2}$ has coordinates $(x_{2}, y_{2})$. This is the set 
                up that we had before.
            </p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{matrix}
                \text{Point 1}: & (x_{1}, y_{1}) \\
                \text{Point 2}: & (x_{2}, y_{2})
                \end{matrix}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>The first thing we do is to replace $y$ with $f(x)$, so that 
                changing $x$ automatically changes $y$ according to our defined function. 
                So, our coordinates are now:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{matrix}
                \text{Point 1}: & (x_{1}, f(x_{1})) \\
                \text{Point 2}: & (x_{2}, f(x_{2}))
                \end{matrix}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>The final thing we have to do is to bring the two points close together. We can do this by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>defining an incredibly small distance $h$</li>
                <li>saying that $x_{2}$ is an $h$ distance from $x_{1}$. In 
                    other words, $x_{2}=x_{1}+h$</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So our coordinates are now:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{matrix}
                \text{Point 1}: & (x_{1}, f(x_{1})) \\
                \text{Point 2}: & (x_{1} + h, f(x_{1} + h))
                \end{matrix}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>Since the only variable we are using is $x_{1}$, we can just write it 
                as $x$. So, our coordinates are:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{matrix}
                \text{Point 1}: & (x, f(x)) \\
                \text{Point 2}: & (x + h, f(x + h))
                \end{matrix}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>Now, we just plug these coordinates into our $y_{2} - y_{1} / x_{2} - x_{1}$</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}=\frac{f(x + h) - 
                    f(x)}{x + h - x} =\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>Previously, we defined $h$ as just a really small change in $x$. We can actually 
                define it in the equation itself using something called a limit:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \boxed{\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>This just means that $h$ is extremely close to $0$, but is not equal to $0$.</p>
            <p>This is the formal definition of a derivative. By plugging in an equation, we can 
                get another equation that gives us the instantaneous slope at any $x$ value.</p>
            <p>For example, for $f(x) = x^2$:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{align}
                &\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h}  \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h} \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{2xh-h^2}{h} \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{2xh}{h} - \frac{h^2}{h} \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } 2x-h \\
                =&\ \boxed{2x}
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>When we plug in an $x$ value of 2, we get $2(2)=4$. The slope of $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=2$ 
                is $4$. When we plug in an $x$ value of 10, we get $2(10)=20$. The slope of $f(x)=x^2$ 
                at $x=10$ is $20$. And so on. You can see how useful this is for almost every field; 
                Real life almost never follows constant rates of change.</p>
            <p>Note that when we take the derivative of a linear function, we get a constant value. 
                This is because the slope of a linear function is always the same:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{align}
                &\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{2(x+h)-2x}{h} \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{2x+2h-2x}{h} \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{2h}{h} \\
                =&\lim_{ h \to 0 } 2 \\
                =&\ \boxed{2}
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p><br>
            <h1>Other Notation</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>You may see a derivative represented as $\Large\frac{ dy }{ dx }$, 
                where $dy$ is an incredibly small change in $y$, (our rise) and $dx$ 
                is an incredibly small change in $x$ (our run).</p>
            <p>For example, for $f(x)=y=x^2$</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \frac{ dy }{ dx } =\frac{ d }{ dx } x^2=2x
                $$
            </p>
            <p>and so on.</p>
            <p>A second derivative, or a derivative of a derivative looks like:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \frac{ d^{2}y }{ dx^{2} } =\frac{ d^{2} }{ dx^{2} }  x^2=\frac{ dy }{ dx } 2x=2
                $$
            </p>
            <p>You might also see derivatives as ticks, or primes.</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{align}
                f(x)&=x^2 \\
                f'(x)&=2x
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>You can keep adding ticks to create second, third, fourth, and so on derivatives:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{align}
                f(x)&=x^2 \\
                f'(x)&=2x \\
                f''(x)&=2
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p><br>
            <h1>Special Rules</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>After finding the derivatives of functions over and over again using the 
                formal definition that we defined above, people began to discover shortcuts. 
                For example,</p>
            <div class="theorem">
                <h2>The Power Rule</h2>
                <p>$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{(n-1)}$$</p>
            </div>
            <p>Using the example of $f(x)=x^3$:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \frac{d}{dx}x^3=3x^{3-1}=3x^2
                $$
            </p>
            <p>So the derivative  of $x^3$ is $3x^2$</p>
            <p>Another rule:</p>
            <div class="theorem">
                <h2>Sum and Difference Rule</h2>
                <p>$$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)]=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)+\frac{d}{dx}g(x)$$</p>
            </div>
            <p>Using the example of $x^2 + 8x + 3$:</p>
            <p>
                $$
                \begin{align}
                &\ \frac{d}{dx}x^2 + 8x + 3 \\
                =&\ \frac{d}{dx}x^2+\frac{d}{dx}8x + \frac{d}{dx} 3 \\
                =&\ \boxed{2x+8}
                \end{align}
                $$
            </p>
            <p>So the derivative of $x^2+8x+3$ is $2x + 8$</p>
            <p>There are many many more rules like this. I'm not going to go through 
                them all, but a quick google search can get you more if you're interested.</p>
            <p>Note that all of these rules also have mathematical and geometric proofs that 
                clearly explain why they work — these don't come from sheer coincidence.
