            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                <p>Suppose you have a graph that shows someone&#39;s velocity in a certain period of time:</p>
                
                <img src="images/integral1.png" alt="the line y=3 from 0 to 10.">
                
                <p>
                    How might we go about finding how far this 
                    person moved? Well, if they moved at 3 meters 
                    per second for 10 seconds, then it makes sense 
                    that they moved 30 meters.
                </p>
                <p>Mathematically this looks like:</p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    &3\mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}\times10\mathrm{s} \\
                    =\ &3\mathrm{\ m}\times 10 \\
                    =\ &30\mathrm{m}
                    \end{align}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if the person&#39;s velocity 
                    graph looked like this?
                </p>
                
                <img src="./images/integral2.png" alt="the line y equals 3 frmo 0 to 5, and y equals 4 from 5 to 10.">

                <p>
                    This person moved at 3 meters per second for 5 
                    seconds. Then, they moved at 4 meters per 
                    second for 5 more seconds. So using the same 
                    method as before, they moved $3(5) + 4(5)=35$ 
                    meters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, in real life people don&#39;t move at 
                    constant speeds â€” they speed up and slow down. 
                    So, what do we do for non-constant graphs? 
                    (for example, this graph of 
                    $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2$)
                </p>

                <img src="images/integral3.png" alt="the line y equals x squared.">

                <h2 id="the-area-under-the-curve">The Area Under The Curve</h2>
                <p>
                    Earlier, when we found distance from a 
                    velocity graph, we can interpret our math as 
                    finding the area under a curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first graph, we made a rectangle: 
                    a height of 3 and a length of 10 gave us 
                    $3 \times 10=30$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second graph, we used two rectangles. 
                    One with a height of 3 and length of 5, and 
                    another with a height of 4 and a length of 5, 
                    for a total of $3(5) + 4(5)=35$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, for our curved line, we can employ a 
                    similar strategy. By using a series of 
                    rectangles, we can approximate the area 
                    underneath the function.
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/integral4.png" alt="a number of rectangles underneath the curve y equals x squared, with height f of x and some equal length.">
                
                <p>
                    Each rectangle has height $f(x)$. By increasing 
                    the number of rectangles and reducing the width 
                    we can get a better approximation:
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/integral5.gif" alt="the rectangles increasing in number and decreasing in size until it appears to conver the area under the function f of x squared perfectly.">
                
                <p>
                    An integral uses this idea and takes it to the 
                    extreme to get a perfect value. it uses rectangles 
                    of height $f(x)$ and width $dx$, where $dx$ is 
                    an infinitely small change in x. Then, it adds 
                    up all those rectangles together. In mathematical 
                    form, this looks like:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f(x) \, dx 
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ is the range of the integral, 
                    the boundaries of where we make and add rectangles.
                </p>
                
                <h2 id="addition">Addition</h2>
                <p>
                    Earlier, when describing the process in which we 
                    would find the area under the curve, I said that 
                    we would &quot;add&quot; the rectangles of height 
                    $f(x)$ and &quot;width&quot; $dx$. This is another 
                    way of understanding the integral: As a continuous 
                    addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let&#39;s use a physical example. Say we have a 
                    line of length $L$. We can break down this line 
                    into infinitely small chunks of size $dl$. So,
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    L = \int dl
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, the integral &quot;adds up&quot; all of the 
                    chucks of size $dl$ to get the total length $L$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now another example. What if we wanted to find the 
                    total mass of some object, say another line? I 
                    would go about finding the mass by multiplying 
                    the length of the line $L$ with the density of the 
                    material $\rho$. But what if the density of the 
                    object changed throughout the material, say 
                    according to some function? For example,
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \rho(x) = x^{2}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the density of the material changes according to what $x$ coordinate you are at. One way to go about <em>approximating</em> 
                    the total mass is to break the line into parts, then find the mass of each part, 
                    perhaps by choosing some point in the chunk to represent the density of that chunk. If we 
                    were to break the line into $n$ parts, then for any $x_{n}$, we choose some random $x_{n}^{*}$ to represent the chunk.
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/integral6.png" alt="a line being broken apart, then a point x i star being chosen from each part.">

                <p>So the mass of some chunk $i$ is approximated by</p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    m \approx \rho(x_{i}^{*}) (x_{i+1}-x_{i})
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    where $x_{i+1}$ is the beginning of the previous 
                    chunk (therefore the end of chunk $i$) and $x_{i}$ 
                    is the beginning of the current chunk. 
                    So $x_{i+1} - x_{i}$ is the length of chunk 
                    $i$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note how we plugged in $x_{i}^{*}$ into the 
                    density function. This is what is meant by 
                    choosing a random point to represent the 
                    density of the whole chunk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To approximate the total mass of the line, we must 
                    sum the mass of each chunk. Here we sum from $i=0$ 
                    to $i=n$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    M \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n} \rho(x_{i}^{*})(x_{i+1}-x_{i})
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>Or with the density function $\rho(x)=x^{2}$,</p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    M \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n} (x_{i}^{*})^{2} (x_{i+1}-x_{i})
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can we get a better approximation? Well, if we 
                    choose smaller chunks (therefore a higher quantity of 
                    chunks in order to still sum up to $L$), we can be more 
                    precise in how we represent density. Mathematically, 
                    we do this by increasing $n$, the upper limit of our 
                    summation. If fact, the more we increase $n$, the better 
                    our approximation.
                </p>

                <img src="images/integral7.png" alt="the number of chunks decreasing in size and increasing in number. A point x i star is still chosen from each.">
                
                <p>
                    This idea of approximating and then improving 
                    that approximation may remind you of the previous 
                    page (derivatives), where we approximated the slope and then 
                    improved in until it was instantaneous. The 
                    breakthrough there was the use of the limit. Here, 
                    we use the same technique. When we take the limit 
                    as $n$ goes to infinity, we get a perfect calculation 
                    of the total mass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    M = \lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{i=0}^{n} \rho(x_{i}^{*})(x_{i-1}-x_{i})
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    This perfect calculation is also known as an 
                    integral!
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \boxed{ M = \lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{i=0}^{n} \rho(x_{i}^{*})(x_{i-1}-x_{i}) = \int_{0}^{L} \rho(x)\,dx }
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that when we have infinite chunks, the length 
                    of those chunks must be infinitely small to add up 
                    to $L$. So the length becomes $dx$. Additionally, 
                    we no longer need to count by $i$, nor take some 
                    random point of $i$, so that goes away. In the 
                    example of $\rho(x)=x^{2}$, we have
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    M = \int_{0}^{L} x^{2}\,dx
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using one of our &quot;Special Rules&quot; (Section below) we can calculate this integral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    M = \int_{0}^{L} x^{2}\,dx = \left. \left( \frac{1}{3}x^{3} \right) \right|_{0}^{L} =\frac{1}{3}L^{3} - \frac{1}{3}(0)^{3} = \boxed{ \frac{1}{3}L^{3} }
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is in this way that an integral can be seen as 
                    a continuous, as opposed to a discrete, summation. 
                    Analyzed closely, one would see that viewing the 
                    integral as &quot;the area under the curve&quot; 
                    and viewing the integral as the continuous 
                    summation are really two sides of the same coin. 
                    In the next section, we will see the third, 
                    perhaps most fundamental side of this coin (not 
                    how coins work but whatever), and how the integral 
                    relates to the derivative.

                    Apart from being seen as &quot;the area under the 
                    curve&quot; and the continuous summation, the 
                    integral is also seen as the inverse of the 
                    derivative. This is most explicitly seen through 
                    the <strong>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</strong>, 
                    below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int_{a}^{b} f'(t)\,dt = f(b)-f(a)
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or in English: the integral from $a$ to $b$ of 
                    the derivative of $f(t)$, is equal to $f(t)$ 
                    from $a$ to $b$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be difficult to see how the integral could 
                    be the inverse of the derivative. How can the 
                    area under a function be opposite to that of 
                    slope of a function? However, through analyzing 
                    the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we see that 
                    it all makes sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does the derivative represent? It represents 
                    the change in a function at some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does the integral represent? It can be seen 
                    as a continuous summation of a function over some 
                    bounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So to take the integral of the derivative, you are 
                    continuously summing the change in a function.
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/integral8.png" alt="the change over points from some function being summed to show the total change.">
                
                <p>
                    I&#39;ve drawn an image to help visualization. The 
                    function $f(x)$ spans from $x=a$ to $x=b$. The 
                    change in the green points throughout the function 
                    is denoted by the blue and red spans, where blue 
                    is an increase and red is a decrease. By summing 
                    up the total change, we find that we get the total 
                    change in the function, $f(b)-f(a)$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, by taking the integral of the 
                    derivative, we are summing up all the small 
                    changes in the function from bounds $a$ to $b$, 
                    in order to get the total change in the function, 
                    $f(b)-f(a)$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By taking the integral of the derivative of a 
                    function $f$, we get the original function $f$ 
                    at the bounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this way, the derivative and integral are 
                    inverses. We further develop this idea in the 
                    next section.
                </p>

                <h2 id="the-antiderivative">The Antiderivative</h2>

                <p>
                    While we have seen that the derivative and 
                    integral are inverses, when we take the 
                    integral of the derivative of some function 
                    $f(x)$, rather than getting $f(x)$ on its own 
                    we get $f(x)$ at the bounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to avoid this, we often represent the 
                    integral without the bounds, like so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int f(x)\,dx
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    This version of integral is called the indefinite 
                    integral, or the antiderivative. The version with 
                    bounds is called the definite integral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The indefinite integral much better captures the 
                    idea that the integral is the inverse of the 
                    derivative, since
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int f'(x)\,dx = f(x)+C
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    But wait, what is this $+\,C$ at the end? This is 
                    called the integration constant, and is a side 
                    effect of taking the integral without bounds. We 
                    no longer get our original function, we get our 
                    function shifted up and down by some unknown value, 
                    $C$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let&#39;s take an example to see how this constant 
                    might shown up. In our example, we have,
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    f(x) = x^{2}+8
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>When we take the derivative of $f(x)$, we get</p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    f'(x)=2x
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we take the antiderivative of $f&#39;(x)$, 
                    we should get back $f(x)=x^{2}+8$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int f'(x)\,dx = \int 2x\,dx = x^{2}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what&#39;s this? The $+\,8$ at the end of $f(x)$ 
                    is gone! Since constants go away during the 
                    derivative process, when we took the antiderivative 
                    we did not get the 8 back. It is for this reason 
                    that we add a $+C$ at the end of our 
                    antiderivatives. So in our example,
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int f'(x)\,dx  =\int 2x\,dx = x^{2}+C
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we knew what are original function was at some 
                    point, say $f(0)=8$, then we could solve for $C$ 
                    to find it is 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                    f(x) & = x^{2}+C \\
                    f(0) & = 0^{2}+C \\
                    f(0) & =C &  & \text{but }f(0)=8 \\
                    8 & = C  &  & \text{we plug in }8\text{ for }C\\
                    f(x) & = \boxed{ x^{2}+8 }
                    \end{align}
                    $$

                <h2 id="special-rules">Special Rules</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Like with the derivative, we found many special rules 
                    to compute the integral. Like with the derivative, 
                    there is an integral power rule,
                </p>
                <div class="theorem">
                    <h2>Power Rule</h2>
                    <p>$$ \int x^{n}\,dx = \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} +C$$</p>
                </div>
                <p>Using the example of $x^{4}$,</p>
                <p>
                    $$
                    \int x^{4}\,dx = \frac{1}{5}x^{5} +C
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that taking the derivative of 
                    $\frac{1}{5}x^{5}+C$ yields $x^{4}$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are quite a few more, but they are more 
                    complicated than what can be discussed here. 
                    In general, computing the integral is much 
                    more difficult than finding the derivative. 
                    In fact, there are a few functions that are 
                    simply impossible to take the integral of, 
                    such as $e^{x^{2}}$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are reasons these rules work, though, and 
                    as you progress through mathematics you uncover 
                    the reasons why.
